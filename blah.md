# About
This presentation will go over some hardening goals for Windows, tools and technigues that you can use to do this, and then finally the way I currently do it.  Any feedback is welcome and I hope this to be interactive, but I can also talk the entire time.  


# Outline

1. Hardening Goals
    * Mitigate exploitable Vulns
    * Lower attack surface
    * Follow a best practice or multiple
        - STIGs
        - Windows security baselines
        - CIS benchmarks
2. Tools and Techniques
    * GPOs - for the pros
    * Microsoft Security Baselines (MSBs)
    * [Security Compliance Toolkit is great for viewing MSBs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=55319)
    * Desired State Config
    * Hacking direct...  reg/bcedit/secedit/auditpol/net, yay!
3.  The way I do it today.
    * PowerShell of course, let's go!
