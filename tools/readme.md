# Overview

Here are some tools that I am wanting to use to 'test' or validate that the hardening settings were, well set.

# Tools

## Hard-Kitty

This one is not what I started with, but like how it is written overall.  I had to modify the CSV for the setting to work for home.

## DFIR Collect

This is deprecated.  Hard Kit had an audit and a setter in the same script, this is what I attempted to use to check before and after.  Leaving just in case and to give Juan Vera some cred for doing it since I tried to use it.

### Hardening Settings 

This setting `1804,"Microsoft Defender Antivirus","Controlled folder access",MpPreference,EnableControlledFolderAccess,,,,,,0,1,=,Medium`
* this creates a controlled access folder, but I can't access my docs??  
* TODO: Need to find the var and set other folders?
